        <p> I love baking because it is so fun. Whenever I have spare moment I turn to baking. I love making cakes and cookies and even fancy desserts like meringes. My all time favorite dessert is a Tres Leches Cake but I yet have to make it myself. Even though I haven't been able to cook as often because I just started middle school I still try and find the time to do so. Just recently I made homemade chocolate chip cookies which are probably the best dessert I've made by myself before. It actually great that I love baking because I have a real sweet tooth and baking at home is way better for you than buying sweets. </p>

          <h1> Baking Tips </h1>
              <h2> The first baking tip is if you are just starting baking ease into it. You want to start by doing simple things like cake or cookies, and you also want to follow the recipe as precisley as you can so you have a better chance at succeding. One more tip that I have is to try and use wheat flour instead of all purpose flour as all purpose flour is horrible for you and wheat flour is better for you, this will help you stay healthy even if you bake alot. </h2>

          <h1> My Inspiration </h1>
              <h2> My inspiration for baking is, my love for baked treats and the kitchen. When I was little I used to help my mom in the kitchen all the time and I loved it, my mom made it so fun by telling stories and letting me take over sometimes. One day I was really craving something sweet and so I thought it would be fun to make a cookie mug cake in the microwave, after it came out amazing this desssert started to become my signature dish and then I started learning new things as well. This story sums up how I learned to love baking.  </h2>
